description: Watch a video for the user. Use when the user shares a video URL (YouTube etc.) or local video file and wants it summarized, analyzed, or discussed — Claude can't ingest video directly, so this skill extracts scene-aware keyframes + transcript first, then reads those.

# claude-real-video — let Claude actually watch a video

## When to use

The user gives you a video (URL or file path) and asks what's in it, to summarize it, to analyze its structure, or to answer questions about it.

## Requirements

- `pip install "git+https://github.com/nullponull/claude-real-video"` (installs the `crv` CLI; needs Python 3.10+ and ffmpeg + ffprobe). This timeline fork keeps frame/speech timestamps; the plain `pip install claude-real-video` (upstream) does not.
- First transcription downloads an openai-whisper base model (~139 MB) automatically

## Steps

1. Run the extractor (add `--grid` to cut image count ~9x — recommended):

   ```bash
   crv "<url-or-path>" -o crv-out --grid --why "<what the user wants to know>"
   ```

   For long videos cap the frames: `--max-frames 60`.

2. Read `crv-out/MANIFEST.txt` first. Its `--- timeline ---` section merges every kept frame and every spoken cue on one timestamp axis (`[MM:SS] frame …` / `[MM:SS] speech …`), so you can see which words go with which visual change; the full `[MM:SS]` transcript follows.

3. Read the contact sheets in `crv-out/grids/` (each is a 3×3 sequence of consecutive keyframes, in chronological order). Only read individual `crv-out/frames/*.jpg` when you need a close-up of one moment.

4. Answer the user's question, citing timestamps from the manifest.

## Notes

- Everything runs locally; nothing is uploaded by the tool itself.
- If the video has no speech or transcription is unnecessary, add `--no-transcribe` (much faster).
- `--kb <dir>` saves a digest into a knowledge-base folder if the user wants to keep notes.
